## About me

I create useless projects that I abandon after 2 weeks. I also love books, manga, the Star Wars universe, Asian food and game modding. I started my IT adventure with programming, but for some time now I've been more interested in cybersecurity. I'm also a big fan of strategy and cooperative games.
